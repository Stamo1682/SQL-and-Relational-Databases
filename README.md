This project focuses on working with SQL queries and relational databases, using MySQL to perform data analysis on a dataset from a customer service system. It includes data on cities, customers, contracts, and calls, with the goal of calculating key metrics like call duration ratios and population ratios.

Files
* SQL_ASSIGNMENT_1.py: Python script to connect to a MySQL database and execute a SQL query for calculating call duration ratios and population ratios​(SQL_ASSIGNMENT_1).
* SQL_ASSIGNMENT_1.sql: SQL file containing the relevant queries and database schema definitions.
* 
*Using Python in this case I connect to the database and implemented the last query again,  (For each city ID, show the city ID, the ratio of the total duration of the calls made from customers staying in that city in 2022 over the total duration of all calls made in 2022, and the ratio of the city’s population over the total population of all cities) – without using GROUP BY SQL statements.*
